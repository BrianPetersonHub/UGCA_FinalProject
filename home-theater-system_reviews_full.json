I'm an audiophile and videophile so the sound quality was nowhere near what I would be satisfied with, but my sister was fine with it. \nSetup was pretty simple, it's all dummy proof with the wiring. The wireless surround speaker setup was fully automatic, works well. Make sure you connect to Internet and download any firmware updates before you bother digging into the settings during setup. By default, all the speaker channels are set to 0db, so the surrounds volume levels are WAY too loud and the sub is WAY too low. An SPL meter will be necessary to balance all the channels with the built in speaker test (you can download an SPL meter app on your phone for free).\nTwo reasons it didn't get 5 stars:\n1) It says it's HDMI output has an Audio Return Channel (ARC) but it doesn't work with my sister's 42\" Vizio with ARC. Everything was plugged into the correct ports, cables were brand-new HDMI 2.2, ARC was enabled on both devices...it should've worked. So I had to back to the store and buy an optical cable to get sound for her FIOS tv. Annoyed...\n2)Within a week, my sister is calling me telling me there is no dialogue when she plays BD/DVDs. After burning an hour of checking it over, I found that somehow the system was sending the subwoofer channel to the center channel and the Front L/R to the surrounds, and completely lost the front channels. This only happened when the internal disc player was in use...when using the optical input (for FIOStv) everything was fine. Turning it on and off did nothing, so I yanked the plug while it was on and left it unplugged for 2 minutes, which seemed to reset everything. Hopefully nothing else silly like that happens again.

We have had this new Samsung for a little over a month. This new 2015 model works great, newest technology, 3D / Smart Blu-ray Home system with FM receiver. This up converts DVDs to give a great picture, almost don\u2019t have to spend the extra money to rent a BD disk, if you have a 42\u201d TV as we do. It was easy to set-up connection to our home Wi-Fi. Make sure you check for and update the Firmware on the system. We had one update on ours already. The small speakers produce a really great sound for a home system in this price range. The wireless rear speakers are not 100% wireless. You have to plug the rear surround speaker wires into a 110v powered wireless box. Accordingly, if you want those speakers mounted on a wall, as we do, you will see the wires, and be limited to the spacing and placement distance from the 110v powered box. The biggest Dislike I have about this system is that I think Samsung made a design mistake by using Proprietary speaker wire Plugs for connection of the speakers to the main and surround speakers rear unit. They should have used speaker wire spring terminal connectors as they used on all of the speakers \u2013 Why use half one type connection &amp; half a different type connection? The spring terminal wire connections are very easy to use \u2013 you have to use them anyway on the speakers! This design totally eliminates the use of heavier gauge better wires (included wires are very thin), unless you cut &amp; splice the included wires! This also restricts the distance you can place the speakers from the main unit (wire size / gauge too small) plus the proprietary plugs on one end. Our rear surround speakers were placed on two sides of an open arch / wall span, so the design eliminates the use of my hidden wires for the rear speakers! According, we can\u2019t place the new ones there now.

I am not fully satisfied with this \"new\" unit.\n\nFirst of all, what was the Samsung software engineering team thinking? You can't adjust the user defined equalizer preset while actually listening to music??? This is very elemental and it should have been a no brainier. In reality, you have to switch away from BT, Aux, FM radio, etc. to go into settings and adjust the user equalizer preset and then go back to a music input to see if it sounds different??? My old Home Theater System had a dedicated button to adjust per channel db and much more. I am talking about the user defined eq preset (you can use the remote to cycle all of the eq presets, including the user defined eq but not adjust anything with music, it has to be done in total silence?). I want to be able to hear something while making eq adjustments to the user defined eq preset!\n\nAnother annoying thing is that if you want to listen to the FM radio while connected to HDMI to a Samsung TV (Anynet + ON), the TV switches input to TV and then the radio starts playing. So, I had to turn off Anynet and now the TV stays on the HTS input and the HTS goes to the FM listening screen.\n\nFinally, why not keep comparability with old HTS remotes? The new remote is a joke, couple with the fact that the front plate doe not have a preset button. So, if you loose your remote, you will not be able to switch stations. My older Samsung HTS Unit that had a button in the front plat to switch between all of the FM station saved presets. This things should not be designed as disposable units. If Samsung design and quality does not go back to how it used to be, for Home Theater Systems, this recently purchase unit will be my last Samsung HTS (3 months old at the time of this writing),", "date": "May 17, 2017 6:29 PM", "recommend": " No, I would not recommend this to a friend", "helpful": "1", "not_helpful": "2"}, "5": {"author": "ItsG", "author_attributes": ["Verified Purchase", "Member"], "rating": "3", "review_title": "Decent system, but there are better ones", "review": "I got a great price for this system around black Friday, plus I had gift cards and certificates.

The first night I purchased it I watched the first Marvel Avengers and the surround sound was good considering it is a smaller theater system. I did like the bass, but there was a little bit of crackling with one of the speakers during certain scenes. The bass was not bad. Set up was easy. Bluetooth is nice.

The setup was very straight forward and simple. The rear wireless system was nice even though there are wires from the receiver unit to the speakers but that was ok because they were going to be hidden anyways. The main unit self linked to the receiver and there was nothing hard about the setup screen. The mids and highs were really crisp and clear however the bass speaker left a lot to be desired. I had the gain turned up to the max and even with a lot of bass signal from the video, the bass was very weak and unresponsive. The old carousel system would rattle the windows if I wanted it to. I was also reading that though this system would support 3D videos, i did not support 4K. As I only have a 1080P/ 3D system, for he moment it was not an issue but one to pay attention to. The real problem started when tried to stream a movie with VUDU. My wifi is through a major cable provider and I have a 60mb download speed. While trying to watch the movie, the video would pause every 5 seconds then play again. It was extremely annoying. I tried to use the Youtube app but ended up with the same results. I did make sure as the reviews suggested to update the unit before I started setting it up. The final straw was while switching between the menu options, the unit would not allow you to make another selection in the menu for several seconds after you finished with one. Even switching between input modes took awhile. Someone else noted this in the reviews and I had hoped it was just an isolated issue.

HDMI ARC allows both directional connection using one cable. No optical or low grade RCA cables need. You must go the TV settings and turn on CEC. This will allow the Vizio to discover connected devices via HDMI. It will allow you to use the Vizio to control the Samsung and vice versa. Other TV brands may be similar. Then you can get surround sound from over the air TV! If you experience any audio/video sync issues, Vizio and the Samsung allow you to adjust for this.\n\nThose who want a 2 channel music stream to play on rear speakers, your expectation is flawed. The rear speakers are only for the extra surround sound channels if such a source is used. FM radio, Bluetooth audio, music CDs are two channels. Not 6.\n\nBlu ray player and Amazon Prime Video and other streaming services work great. Yes Amazon has many titles in HD and 5.1 sound.
