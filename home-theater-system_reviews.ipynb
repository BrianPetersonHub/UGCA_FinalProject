       " 'review': 'I bought this Samsung open-box (saved $50) for my sisters apartment. I\\'m an audiophile and videophile so the sound quality was nowhere near what I would be satisfied with, but my sister was fine with it. \\nSetup was pretty simple, it\\'s all dummy proof with the wiring. The wireless surround speaker setup was fully automatic, works well. Make sure you connect to Internet and download any firmware updates before you bother digging into the settings during setup. By default, all the speaker channels are set to 0db, so the surrounds volume levels are WAY too loud and the sub is WAY too low. An SPL meter will be necessary to balance all the channels with the built in speaker test (you can download an SPL meter app on your phone for free).\\nTwo reasons it didn\\'t get 5 stars:\\n1) It says it\\'s HDMI output has an Audio Return Channel (ARC) but it doesn\\'t work with my sister\\'s 42\" Vizio with ARC. Everything was plugged into the correct ports, cables were brand-new HDMI 2.2, ARC was enabled on both devices...it should\\'ve worked. So I had to back to the store and buy an optical cable to get sound for her FIOS tv. Annoyed...\\n2)Within a week, my sister is calling me telling me there is no dialogue when she plays BD/DVDs. After burning an hour of checking it over, I found that somehow the system was sending the subwoofer channel to the center channel and the Front L/R to the surrounds, and completely lost the front channels. This only happened when the internal disc player was in use...when using the optical input (for FIOStv) everything was fine. Turning it on and off did nothing, so I yanked the plug while it was on and left it unplugged for 2 minutes, which seemed to reset everything. Hopefully nothing else silly like that happens again. Annoyed again...',\n",
