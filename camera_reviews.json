The view screen is generous and bright, easily readable in most settings. The camera also offers a viewfinder which is very helpful when shooting in high glare settings (or when you forget to bring your glasses with you!) \nThe included lenses cover a good range of distances, but you may want to invest in a wide angle lens - a good 12-20mm for getting more into your images (although most of the better ones out there will actually cost more than your camera did). The 75-300mm zoom lens will get you in close to many subjects, but don't expect it to compete with some of those 80x zooms you see on point and shoot cameras! \nChanging out lenses is easy and fast.\nThere are ample settings for one shot, continuous shot, and timed delay shooting, so if you are shooting an active event you can get some great movement shots, and if you want to get into the picture yourself, its easy to do. When shooting in continuous mode, the camera will pause after five shots to let the data catch up - I've found that three shots is the gets keeps me from getting that delay.\nBoth of these lenses shoot a little on the slow side. There is a slight hesitation after pressing the shutter release. I've also noticed that although the 18-55mm kit lens is equipped with an anti-shake feature, it really doesn't do much. So - consider adding a tripod to your purchase too!\nThe picture quality is excellent - I always shoot in RAW and this camera offers six RAW quality settings and the same for JPEG. Or you can choose to shoot both simultaneously if you don't know a lot about the formats and want to learn. Its great to have both formats to do side by side comparisons. \nThis camera does not have an infrared sensor, so if you wish to use a remote, you'll have to use the Canon Camera Connect mobile app - it is available for both IOS and Android devices (sadly not for Windows 10 mobile devices though!). In addition to letting you control your camera remotely, the mobile apps also let you view the pictures on your camera on the bigger screens of your smartphone (I use my iPad - and its great to see a real time image for composition on that screen - believe me!) The app is pretty easy to use and so far I've found it to be stable and reliable, although more so on my iPad than on my Android phone. \nThis camera is also capable of shooting HD movies and that is a terrific feature - but keep in mind, you'll have to master your lenses in order to stay in focus and do efficient zooms and pans. \nOverall this is a great camera. Canon lenses can be used on all their DSLR's, so when you are ready to upgrade to a more professional camera back, you'll be able to keep your lens kit and accessories.", "date": "Dec 31, 2016 2:44 PM", "recommend": " I would recommend this to a friend", "helpful": "102", "not_helpful": "9"}, "2": {"author": "Sportsjunkie79", "author_attributes": ["Elite Member"], "rating": "4", "review_title": "Great starter DSLR kit", "review": "This is a great starter DSLR camera kit. It comes with everything you need (minus a memory card) to take great pictures. You even get a bag that has room for the camera and extras. I heard and read many horror stories about kit lenses but these are pretty good even in low light. This kit is perfect for a beginner. Someone who isn't tech savvy and doesn't want to make a big investmsnt in a camera with a lot of bells and whistles they likely won't use. Then have to buy lenses separately. The T6 is easy to navigate and learn how to use. Especially if you're coming from a Canon point and shoot like I did. I went on YouTube and learned a lot watching videos and went on Canons website too which was very helpful. Canon makes a huge variety of lenses. Most of them are interchangeable with most of their camera bodies. You will have no problem upgrading or picking up other lenses that are better quality or suited for shooting different things should you choose to do so. I will probably pick up a 50mm lens here shortly. The T6 is fairly light and easy to carry compared to many other DSLRs I've seen. This is nice because you'll have it with you more often. The canon camera connect app works seamlessly for wireless transferring of your photos to your computer, phone or tablet which I personally LOVE. The downfall of this camera is the video quality. It may get somewhat better with a better quality lens but right now it is comparable to what my Galaxy S7 edge takes. This is an entry level DSLR through so it wouldn't be realistic to expect it to take extremely high quality video. All in all a good, easy to learn on starter DSLR camera kit for as reasonable of a price as you're going to find.

With the invention of smart phones, all of my SLR camera's were relegated to the closet never to see the light of day again. I have tracked the prices of digital cameras over the last decade and never felt like I could justify purchasing a digital SLR until now. I must say, I am impressed with the value of modern day digital cameras, and I don't say that lightly. The last three trips I took to Thailand have been documented on Samsung android phones, but there are so many pictures that just don't translate the way you want, and since you can now get a complete camera set-up for about $300 less than a smart phone, why not own both? I am blow away by the ability to integrate your camera with your cell phone. The Canon T6 has the capability to connect with your smart phone so that you can mount the camera on a tripod and use your phone as the digital display. through WiFi or Bluetooth, you can upload the picture you want to post on Facebook whenever you want. Also, nothing is worse than missing a photo op because your phone is almost out of battery life. I haven't learned all of the features, but I can tell just from scratching the surface, that traveling with both, will give me the best of both worlds and the competition has not only made camera manufactures make better cameras, they are also very inexpensive. Go and check them out.. I purchased the Rebel T6 because Canon makes a very fine quality product and they have a lot off user support online. How long has the Rebel been around? At least 20 years, and though Nikon may be the choice of serious photographers, at the end of the day, if it isn't affordable and easy to use, what difference does it make.", "date": "May 16, 2018 9:00 PM", "recommend": " I would recommend this to a friend", "helpful": "27", "not_helpful": "0"}, "4": {"author": "Ness253", "author_attributes": ["Verified Purchase", "Elite Member"], "rating": "4", "review_title": "Beginner's Dream", "review": "I've given this camera a 4 only because we haven't yet developed or posted any photos online with this camera.

While we have not yet reached the point of actually posting photos online or having any printed. They appear great on his widescreen computer screen and my 15\" laptop screen. Being a beginner I highly suggest using the Manual setting first and adjusting as you go. This allows you to become more familiar with ISO &amp; Aperture of the quality of photos you're interested in etc., if you're in the process of learning like me. Once you become comfortable then I'd understand venturing into the more advanced settings. \nIn regards to size and weight, it's perfect for my tiny hands! I don't find myself hunched over or having to adjust my hands frequently. It's lightweight (I'd say less than 5lbs) with the standard lens attachment.\n\nSetting up the camera is pretty easy if you're all about reading the Manual first -- like me. I've toyed around with connecting it to my Samsung S7 and found it quick and easy to set up. Although remember to turn off the Wi-Fi/NFC setting afterwards, otherwise you will not be able to access other functions such as connecting it to your computer (e.g. uploading).\nOverall, if you're a beginner or simply looking for an affordable, light-weight substitute to a camera you currently have this is a great option.

It also allows for more flexibility in manual and other settings if one wants to experiment or shoot in low light situations. The lens quality seems good, although I have not yet tested the 300mm lens in low light conditions. One minor drawback was that when first tried out the camera taking photos of Lake Champlain from a park overlooking the water and used the automatic mode, the photos came out very washed out. However after experimenting with AE and other settings, the colors seemed more true. Another minor annoyance is that although the battery is the same size as the one used for the older EOS rebel, the connecting points are different so cannot use my two old spare batteries and charger. It is annoying the way manufacturers keep making minor changes that make obsolete previously good pieces of equipment.

The open flap top gets cumbersome after a while. If you're on the move a lot (ie. snapping photos at the zoo or a wedding) get a camera bag with a zip open top.
