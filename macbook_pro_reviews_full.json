In summary, I have seen the light. The MacBook Pro is the best laptop I have ever owned or used. Gaming aside, this is the best laptop you can get. Period.\n\nFor gaming, Windows 10 or a console are the way to go. I have a gaming PC and that is not going to change anytime soon. For personal use, however, my MacBook Pro is now my computer of choice. I bought a MacBook Air for my wife during Best Buy's $799 Black Friday promotion. She loves it for casual email and web surfing. I tried it out and it grew on me. Fast forward a few weeks and I decided to trade in my iPad Air and Apple Watch 1 and I initially tried a Surface Laptop. I returned it less than 24 hours later due to wifi issues and instead picked up this MacBook Pro at the holiday special price of $1149. I have used it extensively for about a month and here are the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n-Drop dead gorgeous screen, Retina cannot be beaten\n-Fast, the Core i5 CPU has no trouble keeping up\n-Good battery life, I generally can go 8-10 hours of hard use between charges\n-Wakes up quickly, just as fast as your iPhone or iPad\n-OSX has grown on me, its very intuitive once you get the hang of it\n-Oversized trackpad is cool, as is the haptic feedback you get when you press it\n-Laptop is very high quality, the aluminum feels and looks great, nothing feels cheap\n-Speakers are the best you can get on a laptop, plenty of volume and depth and even some bass\n-Not too heavy, it was in my backpack for a recent trip I took and it was fine as far as weight\n-Most content I used on my iPad is available on the Mac, including Zinio, iTunes movies and shows and Outlook app\n-Getting and sending text messages and making and receiving telephone calls on the MacBook is very handy, works so long as the iPhone is nearby \n-Did I mention the gorgeous Retina screen?\n\nCons:\n-Keyboard travel is very short, it takes some time to get used to it\n-No Netflix app for Mac - whats up with that, they have an app for Windows 10\n-Power supply is big and buying a second one for your backpack for trips is expensive\n-Limited connectivity options, this model only has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports and a headphone jack\n-More powerful models can get pricey", "date": "Jan 12, 2018 5:31 PM", "recommend": " I would recommend this to a friend", "helpful": "41", "not_helpful": "8"}, "2": {"author": "JKRecon", "author_attributes": ["Verified Purchase", "Member"], "rating": "5", "review_title": "Perfect laptop for on-the-go ANYTHING!!", "review": "I have always been an apple fan for a long time, i have waited for 6yrs to get my hands on a macbook pro, at first i was very skeptical, i built a custom PC to act as a \"game rig\", and it turned out amazing, price was double but totally worth it! It handled everything i through at it games, word processing for my side business at the time, editing of my pics and videos off my go pro, and it was lightning fast Core i7 extreme liquid cooled, 2TB HDD raid, 32gb of DDR4 Ram, Nvidia GTX 1080TI, 256GB SSD (for OS), ASUS R.O.G Maximus MotherBoard, 42in 4k LG curved monitor. Windows OS 10, Again i built this computer for a purpose to play games!!, I was thinking of going with a mobile (gaming PC) i.e. Asus, MSI, Alienware, but realized they were so big and bulky, picture like caring around a desktop everywhere you go, i sat down and thought to myself what is going to be the soul purpose of my laptop, to play games?.....Well no i built my desktop for that....word processing?...Yea every computer and tablet can do that now days....criuse the web?....well yea my tablet and phone are good enough for that....then i figured it out....i wanted something to handle a little of everything!....but not extreme...lightweight for ease of travel to and from class/work then i saw this macbook sitting there for display at my local bestbuy, i now thought wow price is doubled of a PC, Lightweight, powerful duel core i5 Processor Duo's are more stable for everyday use in my professional opinion, Quad cores are pointless, after a test you will see that quad cores don't even hit all the cores, at full load they will but at basic use they will only use 2, and some of the 8th gen duo's, have faster speeds with the boost feature then the i5 quads!, All-in-all i decided to go with my mac 13in i5 after seeing the beautiful display, ultra portable design, really bright backlight keyboard, and amazing touchpad!, for the price point of this small but powerful machine, very much worth it!, i will be using it for online schooling, picture and video editing with my go pro, and help with my new job. Don't let the HDD size trick you!!! Buy a portable HDD for mass storage and use google drive for everything else!! Computers don't NEED hdd space to function!!

Prior to this I spent a lifetime on Windows and Linux computers. Those who raise the question of price (I did as well) should look at all the indicators, licensing renewals, longevity, resale value, etc.\n\nHere's what I can offer. \n\n- They keys are lower profile than my Dell Precision M3800 which threw me off at first, but now that I've put in about 40 hours of time, I'm typing faster and with less movement.\n\n- The batter lasts a long time. If I charge it fully and show up at the office at 8AM, I won't even think about charging it all day. I still bring my adapter every morning to work but I never take it out of my bag. I expect that from my Chromebook, but from a laptop with such a nice display, with rich colors, contrast and resolution, yea... I'm very impressed. I've been typing on this thing for the last 4 hours non-stop and it's currently at 88% capacity.\n\n- Updates! I already got the latest version of Mac's operating system that was released. Something I didn't realize, upgrades are included. If they come out with a new version of MacOS, I just install it, I don't have to buy it again. If I want to upgrade my Dell, I'd have to pay at least $100 for Windows 10.\n\n- The touchpad is not a button at all. It's just a flat piece of glass, but as soon as you turn it on, it acts as though it is a button. The main benefit is that there are no 'dead zones' on the pad. No matter where you press, it gives your fingers the same response.\n\n- The operating system is paired really well with iPhones. I keep finding more and more integration between my phone and MacBook, and in the most sensible places.\n\n- Macs include \"Boot Camp\", a program that will walk you through installing Microsoft Windows 10 right along side Mac's OSX. I did that right away just to see how it would go. It was flawless and windows ran rather nicely on the Mac. So now I have the best of both worlds, mainly using Windows for games like Lego Worlds.\n\n- The sound system is solid. Lots of bass, clarity, and full volume without vibrations or buzzing. I don't use my speakers much, but it cuts through the room when you're trying to listen to something in a noisy environment.\n\n- The webcam is solid as well.\n\nI was expecting a much taller walled garden, but what I see is a really good marriage of hardware and software, something that I think any company would want if they could pull it off.\n\nWhen I turn my MacBook off I miss it already. Maybe it's the Apple logo, or it's wonderful display, intuitive applications and features. I honestly don't know, but something about this MacBook just makes me really happy and no regret.

It wasn't a bad performing machine, but I wasn't sure the value was there, and I say that as someone with 10 Apple devices attached to my id. I'm no stranger to the Apple tax, but I just didn't feel this computer was as deserving. Its also important to note that I purchased this laptop when it was on sale for $1049. Above this price and it gets even harder to justify. The truth is, however, what choice do you have if you want a MacBook these days? The MacBook Air is priced lower, but is an aged design dogged mostly by its pitiful screen. The MacBook pros with touch bars are wildly more expensive for their gimmick feature that has been a quantitative failure. These more expensive models also needle$$ly hold the extra ports and higher clock speeds hostage from the non Touch Bar models. I'm a touch typing software developer, I like having the row of physical function keys. There's also the 'Macbook' but its generally the same price for vastly less CPU power in exchange for high base storage space. I really considered that model but the 'Pro' was on sale at the time, 128GB is in my opinion ridiculous for a 'Pro' computer. I'm getting by on it, but this laptop is, for me, not my primary machine, I use it on the go, and then work mostly on an iMac at home. I dunno, its just not a great time for apple laptops at the moment. The USB-C revolution hasn't arrived yet. None of the iPhones can even connect to a MacBook without a separate cable purchase. The pricing seems high, even for Apple. The MacBook lineup is central in an unexpectedly, currently, disjointed ecosystem for Apple. \nI'm going to say 'Yes' to the recommend to a friend question, but the truth is it would seriously depend. I think most non-power users would be better served by the 'MacBook'. I think that the Air is past its time and the Touch Bar models are a gimmick, and if this is your only computer don't even bother with the 128GB model.", "date": "Nov 8, 2017 8:27 AM", "recommend": " I would recommend this to a friend", "helpful": "76", "not_helpful": "18"}, "5": {"author": "GoodNewsGuy", "author_attributes": ["Verified Purchase", "Member"], "rating": "5", "review_title": "Best 13 inch MacBook \u201cPro\u201d ever!", "review": "This review is really intriguing to me because this MacBook \u201cPro\u201d is amazing for me and people like me that have a desk job like I have.\nI put the PRO in Quotation marks not because it is not a pro machine; but because pro has been confiscated by many to mean video/photo editing at 5K and 7K raw files. I call this mac a pro computer because professional means so much more than that.\n\nThis computer is pro partly due to the fact that when combined with the rest of the Apple ecosystem everything from sending/sharing files to having all of your contacts and Apple products just work without fuss. Now, I know that the hero there is the software not the hardware; however, when combined, this computer can not be beat.\nWhen it comes to the hardware, the screen is gorgeous, the weight is perfect and the aluminum construction is top notch; but to mention that the keyboard is a pleasure to type on. Why does this matter to me; well it matters because my job requires a great deal of typing and interacting with docs of all kinds. The typing experience on this computer is simply amazing and puts it over the 12 inch MacBook in my opinion. This is where software and hardware come together to form something special.\nI have the base model which is up to the task with everything I have thrown at it so far. Everything even includes the one time I had to edit a 4K video at 60 fps.\n\nThe major issue people point to with this computer is the inclusion of only 2 USB-C ports. I for one have not had to live the dongle life as almost everything I do happens with iCloud. Once the doc is saved on my computer, it is automatically saved to all of my other Apple products!\n\nI did purchase a USB-C docking station that has all types of ports in the back and connects my laptop to a 4K display, all with just one cable! \nIn other words, I never find myself needing an SD card, Ethernet connection, USB port or Video Out port while out on the road. I only need those things while in the office and the docking station works great for that.\n\nIn my opinion this is the best MacBook Pro for office professionals!

Especially individuals who currently already own other Apple products such as an I-Phone or I-Pad. It has everyday features like access to the internet, apps, games, I tunes, I movie, etc. While also having more advance features for school, or even a professional career. Such as, being compatible with Microsoft programs like excel, power point, and word.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria: Over the years I have used a number of different computers including both PC\u2019s, and MacBook\u2019s. I have learned that the key features to make a computer stand out are the display, processor, storage, and design. \n\n\nPros: The MacBook Pro has many unique aspects that separate it from other computers on the market. The 2017 MacBook pro is equipped with a 256 GB SSD which allows plentiful space to store my projects, music, movies, games, and photos. Also, the computer has one of the fastest processors on the market saving those precious seconds on a busy school day. The most unique feature on the MacBook Pro is its sleek sophisticated design. The computer is very thin and light; while also, feeling sturdy. In fact, it is so light sometimes when I\u2019m walking to class I actually get worried I forgot my laptop at home.\n\n\nCons: The biggest road block I faced in my decision to purchase a new MacBook pro was the price. There are many other cheaper alternatives on the market. Although these cheaper versions of the product don\u2019t offer the same features, compatibility, and sleekness of a 2017 MacBook Pro. In order for the mac book to get the elegant updated 2017 design, the designers decided to not add a disk drive to the product. One other annoying factor is that the New Mac Book is not compatible with Apples new headphones. Which have been out since November 2016, when the I-Phone 7 released. \n\n\nOverall: I Think the MacBook Pro is a well built, and well-designed product that really sticks out from the competition. I would 10/10 recommend anyone whom already owns an apple phone, too also purchase the MacBook Pro. The compatibility between the devices will help day to day life be more organized. The reason I gave the product only four stars was the issue with the headphone jack. One of the biggest pros of the owning a MacBook is the compatibility with the I-phone. In the future, I would hope to see them add another headphone jack that can be used with the apple headphones.", "date": "Feb 5, 2018 11:28 PM", "recommend": " I would recommend this to a friend", "helpful": "7", "not_helpful": "1"}, "7": {"author": "Amanda", "author_attributes": ["Verified Purchase", "Elite Member"], "rating": "3", "review_title": "I think I hate it", "review": "I've used MacBooks for a little over a decade. This is the 4th I've owned, and my least favorite so far.\n\nWhat I love:\nI use my Pro primarily for photo processing. I love the retina display, reliability, processing power, and battery life. It's why I own a MacBook Pro. Specific to this version, I love that the speakers are now on right on top, and that the new charger does not use magnets. However, I don't want to give Apple a lot of credit for simply fixing their own bad designs.\n\nWhat I find annoying:\nThis pro has two USB-C ports and a an aux port. That's it. No USB ports, no SD card, no DisplayPort or Thunderbolt Port. I thought I could live with it, but it's absolutely aggravating. I need a $30 adaptor to pull images off my SD card, another $30 adaptor to transfer them to my external hard drive, and once those two are plugged in, I'm out of ports. I can't even charge my computer while transferring images but that uses one of the USB-C ports. \n\nWhat I hate:\nThe keyboard and trackpad. You use them for everything you do - and I hate them. The keys are difficult to press, too big, too flat, too close together - something. I can't tell you exactly what it is about them, but I hate them. And I hate the noise they make. Similarly, I hate the trackpad. I can't tell you what it is specifically about the Force Touch trackpad that makes me hate it so much, but I absolutely do hate it.\n\nAt this point, I don't care if the machine is beautiful or powerful, it is almost too annoying to use, and that makes it fairly useless to me.", "date": "Nov 4, 2017 5:13 PM", "recommend": " No, I would not recommend this to a friend", "helpful": "95", "not_helpful": "61"}, "8": {"author": "JohnB1970", "author_attributes": ["Verified Purchase", "Elite Member"], "rating": "5", "review_title": "Long Time Windows User", "review": "In a nutshell. the best premium laptops on the market currently are this and the Microsoft Surface laptop (although long reliability is still questionable as of yet for the Surface laptop), with that said, I leaning towards the Surface since I'm more familiar with Windows but based on research that showed how easy it is to convert to OS X (Apple Migrant Software) and Windows software like Google Drive, OneDrive and Office 365 works perfect on a Mac.

There are only 2 USB-C ports, and you need to buy adapters for USB/HDMI or other kinds of ports. I bought a multiport adapter which costed $69. (see pic)\n3. The bottom of the laptop is completely sealed, and there are only two small air outlets on the far side (see pic). The laptop got really hot during my test run with Stellaris.

I have compared other laptops and a comparison I have made is, how clean and smooth the images are displayed. It comes in two different sizes and colors, such as the 13 inch or the 15 inch laptop coming in either space gray or silver. It also comes with different storage options, the 13 inch MacBook Pro comes in a 128GB or 256GB based storage, this is especially used for someone who would store a lot of information on their laptop.

I loved that thing and it never disappointed, whether it was the engineering coding program that it ran flawlessly or just typing a late night paper with the battery making it through the night. Unfortunately, the update in technology has taken a toll on the Macbook Pro and it had also been beaten up a bit on my end. I finally decided to upgrade and with Best Buy offering gift cards for the trade in of your old laptop, it was a no brainer at that point. Not to mention the geek squad support that is included. This computer is BEAUTIFUL! I didn't spring for the most expensive one because I do not need all of the storage, but I honestly can't even tell. The 13\" screen seems bigger to be honest and when I play music just from the laptop it sounds phenomenal, not like a party kind of speaker, but for a couple of people out on the back patio, it does well. I have made the normal business documents, to facetime with family, to even play a couple of games and it does it all so flawlessly! I will say if an extra long battery life is your main thing and you are always on the go then I would tell you to go with the Macbook Air. The Pro does have a good battery life but if you are running any kind of demanding application I wouldn't count it lasting longer than a couple of hours. I recommend that you buy the USB-C to USB adapter because it only has the ports for the USB-C so if you have any devices that you used with any previous generation computer then chances are it was the normal USB connection and you will need to get an adapter. The macbook pro seems super light to me and very portable, but I would recommend some kind of case, because even though it is so pretty without one, it can be very prone to scratches. All in all, not disappointed at all and worth every penny! Oh and buy Applecare, I used to work at an electronics store and I saw way too many customers coming in after they broke their apple device and they didn't get applecare and the repairs always cost so much money when if they had only had applecare it would have been so easy and cheap!

I am delighted with my Macbook pro. Productivity is much improved, even over my 3 monitor PC setup. I Grant you that some of that productivity is due to having a faster machine to work on, but a large part is the desktop switching inherent to Mac OSX, and not having to pick up my phone ever few minutes to answer a text (since they show up on my Mac).

I soon learned that there is way more to do then just the \u201ceasy\u201d set up it walks you through. I can see this being a small and frustrating issue, especially for people that aren\u2019t use to the IOS running system. But there\u2019s good news! Apple has amazing customer service. I called Apple with question and they walked me right through it. They were even able to screen share with me and actually point to things remotely on the screen to help me even quicker! Once set up my wife dove right into using it for school and is loving everything about the Mac Pro. It is an excellent laptop for anyone in college and offers built in programs such as \u201cNotes\u201d that will allow you to write papers just like you would on Microsoft office! The difference is you don\u2019t have to buy a subscription to \u201cNotes\u201d and renew it every year like you do with Microsoft Office. The Mac Pro is a very smooth and quick running laptop. I\u2019m so glad I made the choice to invest the money into one for my wife. Yes! It\u2019s an expensive purchase but it\u2019s worth it! I know her Mac will last her for years to come.

On top of that this Macbook Pro also a keyboard issue, after a few months of use, dust gets under the keys and makes it very difficult to use those keys (and can even break them permanently). On top of that you get thermal issues, sure the laptop is very quiet, but you trade silence for terrible performance. When doing anything intensive (editing photos or videos) the laptop will get up to 93C and the clock speeds will slow down. This increases the time it takes for a video to render and makes tasks like photo and video editing really slow. This could have been prevented if Apple used better thermal paste and made the computer louder. So unless you're a really big Mac fanboy (in which I think you should just get an older Macbook Pro to fix most of these issues) just get yourself a nice gaming computer from MSI or Gigabyte, or get yourself a Dell XPS 13 and you'll enjoy it much more than the Macbook Pro.", "date": "Jul 18, 2018 10:13 PM", "recommend": " No, I would not recommend this to a friend", "helpful": "3", "not_helpful": "2"}, "19": {"author": "Nickerbocker", "author_attributes": ["Verified Purchase", "Member"], "rating": "5", "review_title": "Great Laptop, Okay Keyboard &amp; Battery Life", "review": "I had a hard time deciding between this and the 2017 MacBook to replace an old MacBook Air.

In the end, the larger screen and better processor won me over. \n\nOne concern was that the keyboard would be horrible. After a little more than a week of use, I've adapted. It's not a great keyboard. I'm still getting used to the up/down arrow keys being positioned differently than on the MacBook Air. The short-travel keys are not as comfortable to type on for long periods of time, and it's resulted in my missing a few letters every now and then. But I'm gradually getting faster and more consistent on it. It just sucks that the user has to adapt to it instead of it being designed to better facilitate the user.\n\nAnother concern was battery life. The MacBook and MacBook Pro are both officially rated at 10 hours of battery life, but from what I read, I was concerned the MacBook Pro would have trouble actually achieving that. Using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to do general media consumption and basic tasks, I'm seeing about 6-9 hours of battery life depending on load. That's not terrible, but disappointing when the advertised battery life is 10 hours.\n\nOverall, though, this is a great laptop.

There are so many unique features such as the backlight of the keyboard which is an exceptional feature if you are using your keypad in a darker area. Also, this MacBook is extremely quick at processing when your on the Internet. The laptop is very lightweight, easy to carry around and also very user-friendly laptop for those that are new to computers. The battery life is extremely long which allows you to work more proficient and saves a lot of time due to the longer battery life of this laptop.
